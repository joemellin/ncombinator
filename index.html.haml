    %h1 So, here's the deal.

    %h2 You've got a <em>killer idea</em> and a <em>ninja team</em>.

      You want to make a difference in the world with your ideas, <br>
      build an amazing product, and create a huge company.


  -# SLIDE2
  .slide2
    %a{:name => "imagine"}
    %p
      Now imagine, a brother(or sister)hood of other ninjas, <br>
      just like your team, giving you feedback and helping you iterate.


    .ninjas
      - 3.times do |row|
        - 10.times do |col|
          .ninja{add_class("red", :if => (row == 2 and col == 2))}
        %br


    %p
      We'd stay accountable to each other.  Get advice, motivation, <br>
      and user feedback on your products when necessary.


  -# SLIDE3
  .slide3
    %a{:name => "rules"}
    %h2 Say there were only <em>3</em> rules.

    .rule-box
      .num1-icon
      %h3 Ship.
      %p.with-ship-icon
        When the rubber meets the road, all that matters is shipping good product that comes into
        contact with your users.   Typing in "deploy", and learning from what happens next.
        Our weekly schedule is the unspoken "gentle peer pressure" needed to give you that kickstart.

    .rule-box
      .num2-icon
      %h3 Support.
      %p.with-support-icon
        The value of community is priceless.  Especially one of startup founders who care about
        building great products. We all need early feedback on what we're working on.
        So join forces, use each others products, and provide/receive that crucial early adopter user-base and feedback.



    .rule-box
      .num3-icon
      %h3 Share.
      .icon
      %p.with-share-icon
        Learn from others by sharing what's working and what isn't -- whether it's understanding the fine print
        on your term sheets, applying analytical rigor to UX, or scaling your noSQL data store, share with others
        in a supportive, secure community.  Information is off the record and secrets are safe within our network.



  -# SLIDE4
  .slide4
    %a{:name => "ship"}
    %p
      And <strong>each team</strong> would be expected to ship a <br>
      <strong>meaningful product milestone</strong> every week.

    .ship-icons
      - 5.times do
        .ship-icon



  -# SLIDE5
  .slide5
    %a{:name => "compare"}
    %p
      Yeah, it's sort of like that other thing.

    %p
      Except <strong>no equity</strong> taken,
      and <strong>no barriers</strong>.

    %p
      Just a <strong>community</strong> that <strong>motivates</strong>.
