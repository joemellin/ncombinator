            After you join a batch, on the start of the program we get all the startups introduced to each other. There's an informal secrecy to the group, so feel free to speak your minds. You'll be better off if people know what you're working on so they can try your product, and help if there's any challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do weekly dinners (virtual and physical) every tuesday. In SF we'll have pizza and beer, and go till late. You should come ready to demo what you've built, and give feedback on what other people are building.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the most part we'll follow the basic YC program to the best our resources will allow. The second dinner will be prototype day so you'll be expected to put something together of what you're building and give a quick presentation to the batch.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the end of the cycle there will be a demo day where we'll bring together some world class investors to hear your best 2min pitch. We'll also promote these demo day videos to the press.

            NCombinator is easy to get into. But hard to finish. There's no gatekeepers, but there are bouncers. If you aren't making significant progress on your startup and shipping something every single week, you will be booted from the current batch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to provide the motivation to get stuff done every week. You can pivot, change business models, reevaluate. But you have to ship. If we don't hear from you during a dinner or you miss a week, you get a DNS (did not ship) mark (only other NCombinator teams will see this). If you get on the DNS list for 2 weeks in a row, then you are booted from the batch and won't be included in demo day.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's ok, you can join in next batch. But during the batch, there's no messing around. You are here to ship and build traction.

            YES! If you want to bring your startup back to the early days of weekly product updates and fast progress, join NCombinator! We'd love to have you, but no special rules. We know it's harder for a big team to iterate like a YC team, so you'll have to find a way to do it. But the advantages will be enormous to your business.

            Yes, but not your whole team. Take 2-3 of your most awesome devs and put them on a startup for the duration of the period. Fund them to build an amazing business and you'll see much better returns than any consulting project you could take.

            No, not really. Most of our companies haven't even applied to YC. They either didn't want to give up the 7% or didn't fit the criteria of a YC startup. We even welcome YC alumni's who have already gone through the cycle and want to bring back the energy of YC.
